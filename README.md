# EM-Schedule
This repository contains the final project for the NYU course Data Analytics for Public Policy & Social Good, focused on applying data-driven methods to improve resident physician scheduling.

The project proposes and prototypes a transparent, equitable, and demand-responsive scheduling system that addresses inequities and inefficiencies in traditional manual scheduling processes.
